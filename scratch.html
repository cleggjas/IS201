    <h2>The Bee's Knees</h2>
    </div>

    I promise that I'm not actually obsessed with bees I just couldn't decide what to put on here so I asked someone for ideas and this was one of them.
    <div class="mqt">Movie Quote
        <p>"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. 
        The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible."</p>

        <li>About Bees
            <ul>- Bees are essential to the environment: They are vital pollinators, contributing to the reproduction of many flowering plants and crops. </ul>
            <ul>- Bees dance? Honeybees, through complex communication dances, convey information about the location of food sources to other hive members.</ul>
            <ul>- It's none of your beeswax... Beeswax produced by worker bees is used to construct honeycomb cells for storing honey and raising their brood.</ul>
        </li>

        <li>Different types of bees

            <ul>See page on <a href="https://canr.udel.edu/maarec/honey-bee-biology/the-colony-and-its-organization/#:~:text=A%20honey%20bee%20colony%20typically,related%20to%20its%20adult%20age.">Bees</a> </ul>
            <p>"A honey bee colony typically consists of three kinds of adult bees: workers, drones, and a queen. Several thousand worker bees cooperate in nest building, food collection, and brood rearing. Each member has a definite task to perform, related to its adult age."</p>
